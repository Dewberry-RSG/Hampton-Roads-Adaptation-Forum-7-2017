######
Improvements in scientific computing , the emergence of big data, and the need to integrate disparate (and often competing)  standards into the development of cost-effective engineering solutions brings both challenges and opportunities to the designers of infrastructure. This talk will explore approaches to implementing resilient solutions aimed at providing long lasting, effective, and low-impact systems for water resources applications. Emphasis will be placed on methods for incorporating the latest scientific findings, the emergence of open source technology, a discussion on data standards, benefit-cost analysis approaches, and recent projects.
